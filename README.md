*CURRENT STATUS*
3 separate files (besides this README):
-hifilighter_front_end.js
-hifilighter_front_end.css
-hifilighter_front_end.html

Figuring out: how to make highlights more permanent

*COMING SOON*
-(Hopefully temporary!) Use of the rangy plugin for ranges/selections (and possibly another plugin on top of it)
-Backend logic (via RoR)
-Twitter tie-in

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
This will be a plugin for highlighting text on your blog and news site. The default will be that it highlights text yellow and copies the text to a social media sharing feature.

As foreseen, it will be required that you use special tags/attributes for your article paragraphs and possibly incorporate some other light html/css/javascript.

Ideally, will replace rangy/highlight plugin with homegrown solution

*TARGETS*
complete functionality for highlighting between paragraphs
-in progress. highlighting of across paragraphs now possible(!), but now there are the questions of 1) unhighlighting highlighted passages 2) highlighting from the middle of one tag body(?) to the middle of another.
insert popovers
push range location data for each selection to an array/object/json-file
